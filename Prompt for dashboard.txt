Add a Config Flag:

In the control panel (in dashboard_ui.py), add a new checkbox (e.g. “Enable trial updates”) that sets a session state flag (like st.session_state["trial_updates"]).
Instrument the Training Loop:

In your walk_forward.py (or the training loop module), update the logic so that if the “trial_updates” flag is true, after each trial the forecast is generated.
Have the training loop call update_forecast_in_dashboard (or a new variant) after every trial instead of only after a full cycle.
Update Forecast Handling:

In update_forecast_in_dashboard (in dashboard_visualization.py), allow an additional parameter or check the “trial_updates” flag.
When enabled, update session state with the intermediate trial forecast (and optionally store individual trial predictions).
Modify the Dashboard Chart:

In create_interactive_price_chart (dashboard_visualization.py), add optional code to plot each trial’s prediction as separate traces or markers.
Ensure the chart still shows historical data from the training start date up to today, then overlays the current trial forecast (or “race” progress) if enabled.
Synchronize and Document Changes:

Verify that the changes work across modules (dashboard_core.py, dashboard_ui.py, dashboard_visualization.py, and walk_forward.py).
Update any related docs/comments to note that when “trial_updates” is enabled, forecasts update trial-by-trial.

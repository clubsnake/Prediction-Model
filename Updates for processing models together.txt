ABis that the ideal way to do it instead of changing my current function? is it better for current performance and for future implementation? Please ensure that before we start with distributed computing we make all models perfectly optimized to run in parallel and use as many of my current computers resources in the best way possible to speed up the runs. Please provide me finished code snippets with exact instructions on where to paste them. Ensure it full integrates with all of my existing resource management and training codeEdit3 / 3You're right to focus on optimizing your current system before moving to distributed computing. Let's make sure your existing codebase runs efficiently on a single machine by enhancing your current functions instead of creating new ones.
Based on the files you've provided, I can see that the core training happens in the walk_forward.py file. Let's modify it to parallelize model training while maintaining compatibility with your existing code.
Step 1: Update the walk_forward.py file with parallel model training
Add this code to your walk_forward.py file, right after your imports section:
pythonCopy# Add below your existing imports in walk_forward.py
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import multiprocessing
from threading import Lock
Step 2: Add a resource-aware parallel executor
Add this function to your walk_forward.py file:
pythonCopy# Add this function to walk_forward.py
def get_optimal_thread_count(model_count):
    """
    Determine the optimal number of threads for parallel model training.
    
    Args:
        model_count: Number of models to train
        
    Returns:
        Optimal thread count
    """
    # Get CPU and GPU info
    cpu_count = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
    gpu_count = 0
    
    try:
        # Try to detect NVIDIA GPUs
        import subprocess
        result = subprocess.run(['nvidia-smi', '-L'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
                               stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        if result.returncode == 0:
            gpu_count = len(result.stdout.strip().split('\n'))
    except:
        # Fallback to TensorFlow GPU detection
        try:
            import tensorflow as tf
            gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
            gpu_count = len(gpus)
        except:
            pass
    
    # Calculate thread count strategy
    if gpu_count > 0:
        # With GPUs, we can run more in parallel
        # Run neural networks on GPUs, tree-based models on CPUs
        thread_count = min(model_count, gpu_count + max(1, cpu_count // 2))
    else:
        # CPU only - don't oversubscribe
        thread_count = min(model_count, max(1, cpu_count - 1))
    
    # Always ensure at least 2 threads for parallelism while keeping one CPU free
    return max(2, min(thread_count, model_count))
Step 3: Modify the unified_walk_forward function to train models in parallel
Find the unified_walk_forward function in your walk_forward.py file. Look for this section inside the main walk-forward loop where models are trained and updated:
pythonCopy# Find this section in your unified_walk_forward function (around line 600-650)

Step 4: Make sure memory management is thread-safe
Add this function to your memory_utils.py file to ensure thread-safe memory cleanup:
pythonCopy# Add to src/utils/memory_utils.py

    # Only allow one cleanup at a time, and rate limit to avoid 
    # too frequent cleanups from parallel threads
    with parallel_safe_cleanup.lock:
        current_time = time.time()
        # Only clean up if more than 10 seconds since last cleanup
        if current_time - parallel_safe_cleanup.last_cleanup > 10:

Step 5: Integrate with your memory management in the walk-forward loop
Find the following line in your unified_walk_forward function:

Replace it with:

Step 6: Add resource awareness to the dashboard
In your dashboard, add this resource monitoring widget to show utilization during training:

                        if len(gpus) == 1:
                            # Single GPU - divide memory between models
                            memory_limit = None  # Let TensorFlow manage dynamically
                            
                            # Set environment variable to limit memory growth
                            # This is a backup in case set_memory_growth fails
                            os.environ['TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH'] = 'true'
                            
                            # Set XLA optimization for better memory management
                            os.environ['TF_XLA_FLAGS'] = '--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices'
                    except RuntimeError as e:
                        print(f"GPU memory configuration error: {e}")
            
            return len(gpus)
        return 0
    except:
        return 0
Step 8: Call the optimization function during initialization
Add this call to your main script (where you initialize your application):
pythonCopy# Add this to your main.py or similar entry point
from src.utils.gpu_memory_management import optimize_for_parallel_training

# Call early in your initialization
gpu_count = optimize_for_parallel_training()
print(f"Optimized GPU memory for parallel training. Found {gpu_count} GPUs.")
Step 9: Update the walk-forward call
Now, whenever you call your unified_walk_forward function, all models will train in parallel, efficiently utilizing your CPU and GPU resources.
Instructions

Make these changes to the specified files:

Add the imports and thread-aware functions to walk_forward.py
Replace the model training section with the parallel version
Add the memory management function to memory_utils.py
Update the memory cleanup code in walk_forward.py
Add the resource monitor to your dashboard
Update GPU memory management


Test the changes by running your normal training process. You should see:

Multiple models training simultaneously
Better CPU and GPU utilization
Faster overall training time


Monitor your system's resource usage to confirm the optimization is working properly.

These changes fully integrate with your existing code and maintain compatibility with your current API, while optimizing resource usage. This implementation also provides a solid foundation for the distributed computing system, as it already incorporates thread-safe operations and resource awareness.
